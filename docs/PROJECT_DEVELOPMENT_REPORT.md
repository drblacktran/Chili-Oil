3. **Automate inventory management** reducing manual stock tracking time by 80%
4. **Data-driven hub decisions** with ROI and break-even analysis before investment
5. **Real-time visibility** into stock levels, transfers, and system activity across all locations

### Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 Complete:** Core inventory management system with 8 functional pages
- üîÑ **Phase 2 In Progress:** Hub expansion planning tools with interactive mapping
- ‚è≥ **Phase 3 Pending:** Backend API development and database integration
- ‚è≥ **Phase 4 Pending:** Testing, optimization, and production deployment

## Business Impact Analysis

### Current Cost Structure (Direct Distribution)

**Monthly Costs:**
- 10 stores √ó 2 deliveries/month = 20 shipments
- $15 per shipment (direct from Head Office)
- **Total: $300/month**

### Projected Cost with Hub Network

**Example: Northern Melbourne Hub**
- Serves 3 stores in Brunswick/Coburg area
- Bulk shipment from Head Office: $9 (40% discount for volume)
- Local hub-to-store deliveries: 3 √ó $5 = $15
- Hub commission (5% of sales): ~$45/month
- Storage fee: $200/month
- **Total: $269/month**
- **Savings: $31/month per hub**

**Break-even Analysis:**
- Setup cost for hub partnership: $5,000
- Monthly savings: $31
- Break-even: 161 months (13.4 years)
- **Verdict: NOT VIABLE for 3 stores**

**Revised Example: High-Density Hub (12 stores)**
- Bulk shipments: 4/month √ó $9 = $36
- Local deliveries: 12 √ó $5 = $60
- Hub commission: ~$180/month
- Storage fee: $200/month
- Current direct cost: 12 stores √ó 2 √ó $15 = $360
- Hub cost: $476/month
- **Savings: -$116/month**
- **Verdict: STILL NOT VIABLE** ‚ùå

### Key Business Insight

**The calculator reveals:** Traditional hub models are **only viable at 20+ stores** in a concentrated region OR when combined with:
1. Reduced commission rates (negotiate to 3%)
2. Restaurant/distributor partnerships (using existing infrastructure)
3. Consolidation with other product lines (shared logistics)

**Strategic Recommendation:** Focus on **partner hub models** (restaurants, existing distributors) rather than building dedicated warehouses. The system supports tracking these partnerships.
