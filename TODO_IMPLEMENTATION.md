## üéØ Phase 1: Core Inventory Management (CURRENT SPRINT)

### 1.1 Inventory Dashboard Page ‚úÖ PRIORITY 1

**Route**: `/inventory`

**Features**:
- [ ] View all stores in table format
- [ ] Columns:
  - Store Name
  - Current Stock
  - Minimum Stock
  - Maximum Stock (configurable)
  - Ideal Stock (80% of max)
  - Last Restock Date
  - Next Restock Date (Last + Cycle Days)
  - Days Until Restock
  - Stock Status (üö® Critical / ‚ö†Ô∏è Low / ‚úÖ Healthy)
  - Stock Value (Stock √ó Unit Cost)
- [ ] **Auto-calculate next restock date** based on configurable cycle
- [ ] **Restock condition visualization**:
  - Show which condition triggered: Date-based OR Stock-level based OR Both
  - Visual indicators (badges/icons)
- [ ] Summary cards:
  - Total Units Across All Stores
  - Total Inventory Value
  - Critical Stores Count
  - Stores Needing Restock This Week
- [ ] Filters:
  - By Status (Critical / Low / Healthy)
  - By Region (North, East, Inner East, etc.)
  - Restock Due This Week
- [ ] Sort by: Stock Level, Restock Date, Value, Store Name

**Restock Condition Logic** (to visualize):
```javascript
const needsRestock = {
  dateTriggered: daysUntilRestock <= 0,
  stockTriggered: currentStock <= minimumStock,
  critical: currentStock <= minimumStock * 0.5, // 50% below minimum
  upcoming: daysUntilRestock <= 3 && daysUntilRestock > 0, // 3-day warning
}
```

**Questions to Clarify**:
- [ ] What additional conditions should we visualize?
- [ ] Should we show "stock runway" (days until stock runs out based on avg daily sales)?
- [ ] Any store-specific restock rules? (e.g., "Chat Phat always restocks on Mondays")

## üìã Questions for Final Clarification

1. **Sales Velocity**: Do you have historical sales data I should import? Or start tracking from now?
2. **Max Stock Capacity**: What's the maximum stock each store can hold? (For calculating ideal 80%)
3. **Commission Clarification**:
   - Consignment 30%: Store keeps 30% of $12.80 = $3.84, you get $8.96?
   - Purchase 30%: Store buys at $8.96 (30% off $12.80), sells at $12.80?
4. **Restock Conditions**: Any other triggers besides date and stock level?
5. **Store Manager Portal**: Should they log in immediately, or Phase 2?
